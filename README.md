Increasing accuracy on Bank Marketing Prediction 
In this notebook, I am trying to increase the accuracy of Bank Marketing prediction. 
This dataset has been used in many Kaggle notebooks. 
The accuracy scores of previous notebooks are between 80% and 97% as far as I know.
I reach a prediction accuracy of 98% through outliers values handling, missing data imputation, and dataset balancing.
